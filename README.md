# HappyNewYear!
In China, we have a special festival called <b>Spring Festival</b>. It is time when people who are far away from home to go back hometown to gather with their dearest families. It is always the happiest time during the year for our chinese. As a programmer, I'd like to write some scripts to celebrate this special event in my own way. Hope my script will do those who want to display their talent a little favour.

## This repository will include:
### New Year E-mail:
Nowadays, teenagers in China are prefer to use tecent QQ to communicate with each other. Along with QQ, there is what we called <b>shoshuo</b>, some similiar things to the Twitter. I love to write shosho very much. So I wondered, why didn't I just write a script, and for those who <b>like</b> my shuoshuo, will receive a new-year e-mail writed by me in time.
